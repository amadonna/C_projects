# SmartCalc v1.0

#### Implementation of the algorithm

As long as there are unprocessed tokens in the input string, read the next token:

If the token is:
- A number – put it into the output queue

- A function or a left parenthesis – push it onto the stack

- A function arguments separator (e.g. comma):
    - Move operators from the stack to the output queue until the token at the top of the stack is a left parenthesis. If there is no left parenthesis in the stack, there is an error in the expression.

- Operator (O1):
    - While there is an token-operator O2 at the top of the stack, that has greater precedence than O1 or they have the same precedence and O1 is left-associative:
    - Pop O2 from the stack into the output queue
    - Push O1 onto the stack

- A right parenthesis:
    - While the token at the top of the stack is not a left parenthesis, pop the token-operators from the stack into the output queue.
    - Pop the left parenthesis from the stack and discard it.
    - If there is a function token at the top of the stack, then pop the function from the stack into the output queue
    - If the stack ended before the left parenthesis was read, there is an error in the expression.

If there are no more tokens left in the input string:
- As long as there are operators in the stack:
    - If there is a parenthesis at the top of the stack - there is an error in the expression.
    - Pop the operator from the stack onto the output queue

End.


## Part 1. Implementation of SmartCalc v1.0

The SmartCalc v1.0 program must be implemented:

- The program must be developed in C language of C11 standard using gcc compiler. You can use any additional QT libraries and modules
- The program code must be located in the src folder
- The program must be built with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, test, gcov_report. Installation directory could be arbitrary, except the building one
- The program must be developed according to the principles of structured programming
- When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style
- Prepare full coverage of modules related to calculating expressions with unit-tests using the Check library
- GUI implementation, based on any GUI library with API for C89/C99/C11 (GTK+, Nuklear, raygui, microui, libagar, libui, IUP, LCUI, CEF, Qt, etc.)
- Both integers and real numbers with a dot can be input into the program. You can optionally provide the input of numbers in exponential notation
- The calculation must be done after you complete entering the calculating expression and press the `=` symbol.
- Calculating arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation
- Calculate arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation with substitution of the value of the variable _x_ as a number
- Plotting a graph of a function given by an expression in infix notation with the variable _x_ (with coordinate axes, mark of the used scale and an adaptive grid)
    - It is not necessary to provide the user with the ability to change the scale
- Domain and codomain of a function are limited to at least numbers from -1000000 to 1000000
    - To plot a graph of a function it is necessary to additionally specify the displayed domain and codomain
- Verifiable accuracy of the fractional part is at least to 7 decimal places
- Users must be able to enter up to 255 characters
- Bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation must support the following arithmetic operations and mathematical functions:
    - **Arithmetic operators**:

      | Operator name | Infix notation <br /> (Classic) | Prefix notation <br /> (Polish notation) |  Postfix notation <br /> (Reverse Polish notation) |
      | --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
      | Brackets | (a + b) | (+ a b) | a b + |
      | Addition | a + b | + a b | a b + |
      | Subtraction | a - b | - a b | a b - |
      | Multiplication | a * b | * a b | a b * |
      | Division | a / b | / a b | a b \ |
      | Power | a ^ b | ^ a b | a b ^ |
      | Modulus | a mod b | mod a b | a b mod |
      | Unary plus | +a | +a | a+ |
      | Unary minus | -a | -a | a- |

      >Note that the multiplication operator contains the obligatory sign `*`. Processing an expression with the omitted `*` sign is optional and is left to the developer's decision

    - **Functions**:
  
      | Function description | Function |
      | ------ | ------ |
      | Computes cosine | cos(x) |
      | Computes sine | sin(x) |
      | Computes tangent | tan(x) |
      | Computes arc cosine | acos(x) |
      | Computes arc sine | asin(x) |
      | Computes arc tangent | atan(x) |
      | Computes square root | sqrt(x) |
      | Computes natural logarithm | ln(x) |
      | Computes common logarithm | log(x) |


## Part 2. Bonus. Credit calculator

Provide a special mode "credit calculator" (you can take banki.ru and calcus.ru as an example):
- Input: total credit amount, term, interest rate, type (annuity, differentiated)
- Output: monthly payment, overpayment on credit, total payment
